% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered

\section*{Contribution Statement}
% Explain here, in one sentence per person, what each group member contributed. 
% For example, you could write: Max Mustermann collected and prepared data. Gabi Musterfrau and John Doe performed the data analysis. 
% Jane Doe produced visualizations. All authors will jointly wrote the text of the report. 
% Note that you, as a group, a collectively responsible for the report. Your contributions should be roughly equal in amount and difficulty.
This project was done in a group of three. Because of the amount of different data sources, there is no clear division of work. All of 
us worked on the data collection and analysis. Building on that work, each of us also produced visualizations for their part of the analysis.
Writing of the report was split between the group members. 
Vojtěch Sýkora wrote the abstract and the introduction. Nam Nguyen wrote the data and methods section. Denis Kovačević wrote the results and the discussion section.
