    Even though medicine advances further each day, health risks are
    still present. In this paper, we will analyze the most common health concerns from 1990
    to 2019 in Germany in comparison to the rest of the world, with a focus on more 
    developed countries. We used data with multiple features, such as the number of 
    incidences of diseases and indicators of lifestyle and healthcare systems. 
    We will show which diseases are the most common in Germany and their statistical
    significance using a permutation test. We analyze the difference in lifestyle 
    and healthcare indicators and their effect on the incidence rate of ischemic heart
    disease using a random forest model. In the end, we will show the importance of
    each feature. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/sykoravojtech/IHD_germany_2024}.
