    In this project we plan to analyze which diseases and to what degree are more frequent due to polluting factors. We plan to use two datasets, the first one can be generated using the \href{https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/}{Global Burden of Disease} website and it consits of statistics for a lot of diseases. The other dataset can be generated using \href{https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators/}{The World Bank} website, where we can find a lot of information about pollution. These topics have a top priority in our society today. Pollution is at an all time high, and we find it really important to determine how it influences our everyday health. We are planning to analyze how has the number of cases of certain diseases in countries changed over time, and compare it to change of some polluting factors in those countries. We expect that with higher pollution rates, some respiratory diseases and some types of cancer have become more frequent during recent years. We also hope to find more interesting findings concerning other types of diseases.
