    Even though medicine advances further each day, health risks are
    still present. In this paper, we analyze the most common health concerns from 1990
    to 2019 for Germany in comparison to the rest of the world, with a focus on more 
    developed countries. To achieve that, we focused not only on data about the diseases, but also on their factors such as healthcare systems and indicators of lifestyle.
    We show which diseases are the most common in Germany and their statistical
    significance using a permutation test. We analyze the difference in lifestyle 
    and healthcare and their effect on the incidence rate of ischemic heart
    disease using a random forest model. In the end, we show the importance of
    each feature. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/sykoravojtech/IHD_germany_2024}.
