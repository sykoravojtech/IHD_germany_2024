    In an era of advanced medicine, health risks persist. 
    This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the most common health concerns from 1990 to 2019 for Germany comparing them to the rest of the world, with a focus on more developed countries. 
    Utilizing a combination of disease data and data about disease factors, such as healthcare systems and indicators of lifestyle, we show cardiovascular diseases being a major issue, with ischemic heart disease being their largest contributor, and we show their significance using a permutation test. 
    We analyze the difference in lifestyle and healthcare and their effect on the death rate of ischemic heart disease using combination of a visual analysis and a random forest model. In the end, we show the importance of each factor for predicting the death rate.
