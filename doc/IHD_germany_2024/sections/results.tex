In this section outline your results. At this point, you are just stating the outcome of your analysis. You can highlight important aspects (``we observe a significantly higher value of $x$ over $y$''), but leave interpretation and opinion to the next section. This section absoultely \emph{has} to include at least two figures.

    for Germany in comparison to other high income countries and the world.}

% CVDs death and incidence, Permutation test
Figure \citep{GBD2019} with how it shows the real issue CVDs are in Germany compared to HIC and GLO. Talk about the permutation test. 

% plot age distribution
CVDs are way more prominent for older people (perhaps a plot for inc rate in age groups). 

% Why we focus on high income countries (already in data & methods)
% bubble plot
so comparing with all of the world countries will not give a good reasoning for life expectancy. limit ourselves to some countries with high income and high avg age (we could make a bubble plot of some sort for it) (also helps that we don't have data for all the factors for all the countries).

% analyze the factors, together or separately for healthcare and lifestyle. final plots and points
% alcohol, smoking, fat
