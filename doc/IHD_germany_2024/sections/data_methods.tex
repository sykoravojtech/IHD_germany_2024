In this section, describe \emph{what you did}. Roughly speaking, explain what data you worked with, how or from where it was collected, it's structure and size. Explain your analysis, and any specific choices you made in it. Depending on the nature of your project, you may focus more or less on certain aspects. If you collected data yourself, explain the collection process in detail. If you downloaded data from the net, show an exploratory analysis that builds intuition for the data, and shows that you know the data well. If you are doing a custom analysis, explain how it works and why it is the right choice. If you are using a standard tool, it may still help to briefly outline it. Cite relevant works. You can use the \verb|\citep| (whole citation in parenthesis) and \verb|\citet| (only year in parenthesis) commands for this purpose \citep{mackay2003information}.

Obtaining non-sparse data for all countries in the world over a long time horizon is quite difficult.

We began by exploring ourselves if cardiovascular diseases are in Germany truly abnormal with comparison to the rest of the world. In all of our analysis we wanted to include a closer comparison with high-income countries since Germany is one of them and comparing countries with similar healthcare and gdp could lead to more concrete results. There is not a wide variety of enormous datasets including data about all countries over a long time period and the one that we decided to use for Figure \ref{Cardiovascular diseases over time} was the Global Burden of Disease study \citep{GBD2019}. The filtering on their website makes it easy to download only the data we truly needed. We obtained information about the death rate and incidence rate of CVDs for all countries divided into 5-year age groups for years 1990-2019. The data also included a lower and upper bound for uncertainty. The only change we did outselves was leaving only the rows corresponging to the sum of all age groups.

Furthermore, CVDs are a group of diseases and to get to the root of the issue we needed to investigate which specific diseases from this group take up the majority of cases. For this we went back to \citep{GBD2019} and requested data about specific CVDs. There was too much data for one file which meant that we had to combine files and filter out unwanted data as to leave us only with the number of deaths grouped by disease only for Germany. 
% THIS IS STILL IN THE OLD REPO 

Since a disease death rate and incidence rate may largely rely on the healthcare system of a country, we decided to research if there are any valid healthcare indicators. Unfortunately, finding such an indicator for all countries did not lead anywhere, we decided to combine existing data on number of hospital beds, health spending, and ... TODO ...
Which was then plotted in a bubble plot. This data came form various different sources ... TODO ...

Here add stuff about correlation data like alcohol, smoking, fat ...
