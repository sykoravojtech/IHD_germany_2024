% Motivate the problem, situation or topic you decided to work on.
Germany, one of the largest economies in the world with its advanced healthcare 
system, faces an intriguing paradox: its life expectancy lags behind other 
high-income countries. This discrepancy, as highlighted in the analysis by 
\citet{Jasilionis2023} in "\textit{The underwhelming German life expectancy}," 
poses critical questions about the underlying factors contributing to this 
phenomenon.

% Describe why it matters (is it of societal, economic, scientific value?).
The underlying reasons are still undefined. This paper aims to add to 
the work of \citet{Jasilionis2023} focusing on cardiovascular diseases. In 2019,
they were the leading cause of death in Germany, accounting for 38\% of all deaths. 
We will also put a special emphasis on ischemic heart disease, which is the
most common cardiovascular disease in Germany.

Firstly, we will analyze cardiovascular diseases in Germany from 1990 to 2019 
and compare them to the rest of the world (\Cref{sec:cardiovascular_data}). One of the 
biggest obstacles in our analysis was the lack of data that matches our data for 
diseases in terms of time period and countries (\Cref{sec:data_sources}). We present 
our model for the death rate of ischemic heart disease and its interpretation 
(\Cref{sec:results}). Finally, we discuss our results and limitations of our analysis 
(\Cref{sec:discussion}).
