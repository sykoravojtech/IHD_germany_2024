Germany, one of the largest economies in the world with its advanced healthcare system, faces an intriguing paradox: its life expectancy lags behind other high-income countries. This discrepancy, as highlighted in the analysis by \citet{Jasilionis2023} in "\textit{The underwhelming German life expectancy}," poses critical questions about the underlying factors contributing to this phenomenon. Among these, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) emerge as a significant area of concern.

% Describe why it matters (is it of societal, economic, scientific value?).
The reasons behind phenomenon still lay unanswered. This paper aims to continue with the work of \citet{Jasilionis2023} focusing on the most impactful disease out of CVDs and investigating how elements such as an aging population, lifestyle choices, and dietary habits might correlate with the incidence of CVDs.

% Outline the rest of the paper (use references, e.g.~to \Cref{sec:methods}: What kind of data you are working with, how you analyse it, and what kind of conclusion you reached. The point of the introduction is to make the reader want to read the rest of the paper.
To obtain data for such analysis, we used the immense dataset of the World Development Incicators by the \citet{worldbank_wdi}. This dataset provided us with a wide variety of factors to explore while offering data on the specific diseases we were trying to investigate.
