# Folder structure
- This folder is for the images used in *paper.tex* so that they are automatically saved and refreshed in the tex file. 
- Each image has its corresponding .py file which shares the name of the image file.
- All files begin with fig_ to show that its a file for creating an image.
- Filenames: fig_{image_name}.{.py/.pdf}
